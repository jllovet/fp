# FP - Functional Programming Primitives for Go

## About

This package provides a set of primitives for functional programming in Go.

It aims to make functions that are easy to test, are composable, and minimize the use of side-effects such as the mutation of external state. This is done to make programming more predictable, more declarative, and easier to reason about.
